# kave

The project presents a technique to determine a developer based on their Visual Studio IDE event data. The KaVE data set was used  which recorded IDE activities from 85 developers. The dataset has the active window (windows within the IDE) that have received developer clicks and edits behavior (without any of the actual code information). The problem will be analyzing the connection between developers activities, edits behavior, duration spent on the activity, etc.
